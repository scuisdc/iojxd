## iojxd

iojxd is an lightweight asynchronous I/O wrapper for libev, written in C++ and providing interface for C++ and Lua. It could be used as a library for asynchronous programs, or a platform for network applications.

This project is initially built as a backend for [ISDCNext](https://github.com/scuisdc/ISDCNext) Online Judge service.

Available for UNIX operating systems, tested with OS X and Linux.
